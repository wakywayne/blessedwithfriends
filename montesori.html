                      <h2>What is Montessori and Why is it Important?</h2>
                      <p>
                        Montessori is a method of education that is based on
                        self-directed activity, hands-on learning and
                        collaborative play. In Montessori classrooms children
                        make creative choices in their learning, while the
                        classroom and the teacher offer age-appropriate
                        activities to guide the process. Children work in groups
                        and individually to discover and explore knowledge of
                        the world and to develop their maximum potential.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        My name is Nicole and I am a Montessori teacher. I have
                        been teaching for 10 years and I have seen the benefits
                        of Montessori education first hand. I have seen children
                        who were once shy and reserved become confident and
                        outgoing. I have seen children who struggled with
                        reading and writing become avid readers and writers. I
                        have seen children who were once disinterested in
                        learning become passionate about learning. Montessori
                        education is truly transformative and I am so grateful
                        to be a part of it.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        I have seen first hand the benefits of Montessori
                        education and I am passionate about sharing these
                        benefits with others. I believe that every child
                        deserves the opportunity to reach their full potential
                        and I believe that Montessori education provides the
                        best opportunity for children to do so. I am excited to
                        share my knowledge and experience with you and I hope
                        that you will join me on this journey.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Montessori education is based on the principles of
                        respect, independence, and freedom within limits.
                        Children are encouraged to explore their interests and
                        to learn at their own pace. They are given the freedom
                        to choose their own work and to work independently. They
                        are given the opportunity to develop their own interests
                        and to pursue their own passions. Montessori education
                        is truly child-centered and it is designed to meet the
                        needs of each individual child.
